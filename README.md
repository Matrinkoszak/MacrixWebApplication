1. Unfortunetly, I've run out of time to implement testing. Hopefully I'll manage to update it soon.

2. During the project I realized I could style the table more dynamically if instead of providing data in singular table, I'd populate a flexbox with components representing singular table records. Unfortunetly I didn't have time to start from scratch, so hopefully this implementation is acceptable.
